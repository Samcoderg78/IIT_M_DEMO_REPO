## Data Scraping Explanation

The data was scraped using the GitHub API. First, I queried for users in Berlin with more than 200 followers. For each user, I extracted relevant information, including their bio, company, location, and follower counts. Subsequently, I retrieved their public repositories to analyze their activity and engagement.

## Interesting Fact

One surprising finding was that users with longer bios tend to have significantly more followers, suggesting that a well-crafted bio may enhance a user's visibility and attract more followers.
